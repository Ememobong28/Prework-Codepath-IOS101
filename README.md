## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- **Spotify**
   - Custom Playlists: It makes unique playlists like 'Discover Weekly', helping you find new music based on what you like.
   - Use it Anywhere: You can listen to your music on different devices – phones, computers, even smart speakers.
   - Podcasts: Alongside music, there's a huge selection of podcasts to dive into.

- **Notion**:
   - All-in-One Workspace: It's super flexible – you can take notes, manage projects with kanban boards, set up wikis, and plan with calendars.
   - Make it Yours: You can tailor templates to fit exactly what you need, whether it's for work or personal use.
   - Teamwork Made Easy: Great for collaborating in real-time, making it ideal for both personal projects and team tasks.
 
 
 **App Idea: EcoJourney**

  Think of EcoJourney as your personal guide to a greener lifestyle. This app would help you track your daily habits like traveling, using electricity, and what you eat to calculate your carbon footprint. It's like a fitness tracker, but for the environment. You'll get personalized tips on how to live more sustainably and even earn rewards for hitting eco-friendly goals. Plus, there would be a community feature to connect with others on the same journey. The goal is to make being eco-friendly fun, rewarding, and easy to keep track of.

## Notes

For now I don't see any challenges so far.
